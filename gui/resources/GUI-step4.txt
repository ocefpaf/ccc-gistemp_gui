Step 4: Sea Surface Temperatures. Gridded sea surface
temperatures are read from a file prepared by GISS using
data from other published sources and possibly revised with
recent monthly updates. Sea surface temperature data are only
used if the location is ice free all year, data from locations
containing sea ice are discarded. This step is documented in
Hansen et al 2010 (and possibly elsewhere).
