Step 0: Assimilates input data from various sources
(usually GHCN, USHCN, SCAR READER, and a single
priv. comm. record for Hohenpeissenberg).  Each
USHCN record is adjusted so that its recent seasonal
cycle matches the recent seasonal cycle for the
corresponding GHCN record (not documented in the
literature).  GHCN data for Hohenpeissenberg is
replaced with priv. comm. data (not documented in
the literature). Hansen et al 2010 documents the
use of SCAR READER data.
