Step 3: Gridding.  A grid of cells is selected (8000
equal area cells covering the globe, see note below),
and for each cell a composite series is computed from
station records within 1200 km of the cell centre.
Each contributing record is weighted according to its
distance from the cell centre, linearly decreasing to
0 at a distance of 1200 km. This step is documented in
Hansen and Lebedeff 1987.

A note on gridding

The grid used (in step 3 and subsequently) divides the
globe into 8000 equal area cells. It is based on the zonal
scheme outlined in Step 5 above. There are 4 zones per
hemisphere, and the choice of sines means that the zones
have areas in the ratio 4:3:2:1. Each zone is divided by
longitude into a number of boxes proportional to the area
of the zone: 16, 12, 8, 4. Thus there are 80 boxes, all having
the same area. Each box is divided into 100 (10 by 10) cells
each having equal area.
