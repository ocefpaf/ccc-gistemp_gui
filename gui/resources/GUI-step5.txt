Step 5: Ocean merging. Ocean (Sea Surface Temperatures) and
Land (Near Surface Air Temperatures) are "merged". A cell
that has both ocean and land records selects either the
ocean or the land record: the land record is discarded unless
the ocean record is short or the land record has a contributing
land station within 100 km (in which case the ocean record is
discarded).  This part is documented in Hansen et al 1996.
In ccc-gistemp in order to produce three analyses for land-only,
ocean-only, and combined land--ocean, three maps of cells are
produced and go forward to the following Zonal and Global Average
steps: one containing only land data, one containing only ocean data,
and one containing mixed land and ocean data as described above.

Zonal Averages. Each hemisphere is divided into 4 zones by
splitting at the latitudes that have sines of 0.4, 0.7, 0.9
(and 0 and 1); the latitudes of the zone boundaries are
approximately 23.6, 44.4, and 64.2 degrees. For each zone
all the cells in that zone are combined into a single record.
Large regional averages (hemispheres, tropics, northern- and
southern-extratropics) are computed by combining zones in various
combinations, each zone weighted according to the zone's area.
Zonal averaging is documented in Hansen and Lebedeff 1987 and
Hansen et al 2006 (each of which describes an alternate scheme,
the latter is what is currently implemented, but relictual code
exists for the former).

Global Average. A global series is computed by combining northern-
and southern-hemisphere series, weighted equally.

Annual series are computed from their monthly counterparts.
