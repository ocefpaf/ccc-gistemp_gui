Step 1: A feature of GHCN (a major data source) is
that a single station can have multiple overlapping
records (from different original sources). These are
reconciled where possible, by offsetting overlapping
records by their average difference, and combining
them into one record. Two stations (Lihue and St Helena)
are adjusted to remove a step change in the record.
Under the control of a configuration file, various
stations and periods of station records are discarded
(as being unfit for subsequent analysis). Hansen et al 1999
documents the QC procedures that lead to discarding
station data; it also documents the Lihue and St Helena
adjustment (also documented in Hansen et al 2010); and
it documents the method by which multiple records at the
same location are combined.  Some of the discarded
stations in the US are documented in Hansen et al 2001.
