Step 2: Urban Adjustment. (short records are
discarded). Stations identified as urban (usually
using values obtained from satellite measurements
of nighttime brightness) have their trend adjusted to
match the trend of a composite record made from nearby
rural stations. At least 2/3 of the adjusted period
must have 3 rural stations contributing to the composite
record.  Periods and stations that do not have sufficient
support from rural stations are dropped. The composite
rural record is made from rural stations with 500 km, or
1000 km if necessary to meet the sufficient stations
requirement. This step is documented in Hansen et al 1999
(the basic scheme), Hansen et al 2001 (allowing the break
point in a two leg fit to vary in time), and Hansen et al 2010
(the use of satellite nightlights).
