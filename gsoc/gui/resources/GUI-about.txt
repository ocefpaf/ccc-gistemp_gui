Overview of ccc-gistemp

ccc-gistemp is a software product written in the Python programming
language.  It is a replication of GISTEMP.  GISTEMP (and hence
ccc-gistemp) is a reconstruction of global historical temperature
anomalies, and is described by its author's at NASA on their webpage:
http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/ .  ccc-gistemp is a product of the
Clear Climate Code project and the Climate Code Foundation.  It attempts
to do exactly the same thing that GISTEMP does, but with an emphasis on
making the code clear.

Broadly the GISTEMP algorithm takes historical temperature data from
land-based weather stations as input, and combines these data to
produce an estimate of temperature change over large regions.  In
addition, sea surface temperate data (which has already been processed
to some extent) can be combined with land station data.

The key GISTEMP paper is Hansen and Lebedeff 1987 which describes the
basic gridding scheme.  There have been many modifications to the
algorithm since then, but a recent review of GISTEMP, Hansen et al
2010, documents most of those parts that are not in the 1987 paper
(collecting documentation that was previously scattered about many
different publications).
